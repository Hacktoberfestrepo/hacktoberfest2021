## Event details :

- Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## HacktoberFest Rules :

To earn your Hacktoberfest <b> t-shirt 👕 </b> or <b> tree reward 🎄</b>, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). Pull requests can be made in any participating <b>GitHub</b> or <b>GitLab </b> hosted repository/project. 

Look for the <b>'hacktoberfest' </b> topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 55,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
