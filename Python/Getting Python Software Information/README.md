# Getting Python Software Information :

## Modules required:
#### Platform:  
Platform is an in-built module in Python. It is used to get any kind of information about the system or platform on which we are executing the program, currently. Not only the system information ,but it is also helpful to fetch information about our Python software running on the system.

#### Installation:  
It comes with python installation, therefore we don’t need to install it.

#### Approach:
1. Firstly, we have to import the platform module.

2. Further, we will see some of the useful platform functions .

A. platform.python_version() – displays the version of the python software(for example – 3.4.10 , 3.7.10).

B. platform.python_version_tuple() – displays the version of the python software in tuple.

C. platform.python_build() – returns the build info of the python software.

D. platform.python_compiler() – helps to know about the compiler.

E. platform.python_implementation() – returns python implementation(for example- CPython, PyPy, Jython ) .
